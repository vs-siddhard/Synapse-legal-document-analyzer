 General Description
 Synapse â€“ Legal Analyzer is an AI-powered platform that automates legal document review using
 IBM Watson and Granite LLM. It extracts, classifies, and summarizes clauses from contracts, making
 them easy to understand. Users can identify missing or risky clauses, compare document versions,
 and get real-time legal insights. An interactive AI assistant provides contextual explanations and
 suggestions. The system supports smart search using natural language queries. Designed with a
 clean, responsive UI, Synapse simplifies legal workflows. It saves time, reduces costs, and makes
 legal understanding accessible to all.
 Novelty / Uniqueness:
 Synapse offers clause-level intelligence, not just document summarization, making analysis deeper
 and more actionable. It detects missing clauses and benchmarks existing ones against industry
 standards. The AI assistant is contextual and interactive, not static. Smart version comparison
 provides clause-level redlining and impact assessment. Natural language search enables semantic
 queries across multiple documents. Real-time processing with confidence scores adds transparency
 to AI decisions. These features combine legal domain knowledge with modern GenAI capabilities.
 Business / Social Impact:
 Socially, Synapse promotes legal accessibility by simplifying complex terms for non-experts, helping
 startups and individuals understand contracts. It supports access to justice by reducing reliance on
 expensive legal consultations. On the business side, it saves time and reduces legal costs while
enhancing compliance. Clause benchmarking and risk scoring protect organizations from liability.
 The smart assistant and search tools enable fast, insightful document review. Overall, it delivers
 fairness, speed, and security to legal workflows.
